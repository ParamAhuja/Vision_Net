# Vision Net

**Vision Net** is a cutting-edge security protocol designed to revolutionize vehicle tracking and surveillance. By leveraging advanced deep learning and artificial intelligence techniques, Vision Net identifies and tracks motor vehicles across a CCTV network and maps their locations in real time using the powerful **Mapbox API**. This project provides an effective solution for monitoring vehicle movements, enhancing public safety, and supporting security operations.

## üìå Features

- **Real-Time Vehicle Tracking**: Utilizes deep learning models to detect and track motor vehicles through live CCTV footage.
- **Location Mapping with Mapbox API**: Displays vehicle locations on an interactive Mapbox map, providing a clear, real-time overview.
- **Efficient Data Processing**: Uses optimized AI models for high-speed processing and minimal lag.
- **Enhanced Security Protocol**: Ideal for law enforcement, traffic monitoring, and security agencies to improve response times and situational awareness.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Vehicle Detection**: Vision Net leverages trained deep learning models to analyze frames from CCTV footage and detect motor vehicles.
2. **Tracking Across Frames**: Once identified, the vehicle is tracked across multiple CCTV cameras in the network, maintaining an accurate trail.
3. **Mapping Vehicle Locations**: Using the Mapbox API, Vision Net maps vehicle locations based on their real-time coordinates, displaying their movement on an interactive map interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning & Artificial Intelligence**: For vehicle detection and tracking in CCTV footage.
- **OpenCV**: To handle video processing and image recognition tasks.
- **Mapbox API**: For mapping and displaying the real-time locations of tracked vehicles.
- **Flask** (or any chosen backend): For server-side processing and API integrations.
- **JavaScript & React**: For front-end UI and real-time map visualization.

## üì¶ Installation

To set up Vision Net locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohitGoyal09/HacktheFall.git
   cd HacktheFall
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - **Backend**:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - **Frontend**:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Setup Mapbox API Key**:
   - Sign up for [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and obtain an API key.
   - Add the API key to your environment variables or configuration file.

4. **Run the Application**:
   - **Backend**:

     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

   - **Frontend**:

     ```bash
     npm run start
     ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. Access the live tracking interface via the provided URL.
2. The map will display tracked vehicles as they are identified and located by Vision Net.
3. Use the interface to zoom in/out, view real-time movements, and track specific vehicles.

## üìö Future Enhancements

- **Historical Data Tracking**: Allow retrieval of past tracking data for analysis.
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Add dashboards for insights on traffic patterns and behavior.
- **Additional Camera Support**: Scale to support a wider CCTV network.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up real-time alerts for specific vehicle tracking scenarios.
